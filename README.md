# NeatDinosaurGame
This project uses pygame to create the popular dinosaur jumping game minus the birds that occurs when your offline and trying to use Chrome.
I used the NEAT algorithm which stands for NeuroEvolutionaryAugmentedTopologies which ustilise genetic algorithms to teach neural networks how to play the game.
I used vizualise.py to show the current best performing neural network with the posibilites of saving later.
